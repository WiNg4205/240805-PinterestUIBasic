This is a basic pinterest UI which includes the navbar and clickable routes. Only the Home route has content with unlimited scroll of an infinite feed filled with the vite and react logos. The explore route has basic text and the create route is empty.

This is the second of my social media basic UI series. I can see a lot of improvement in knowledge as it took me only about an hour and a half to style the navbar this time. Here are some things I learnt today:
- I should use 'w' and 'h' more for containers
- flex grow on on specific div is very convenient for responsiveness
- how to implement unlimited scrolling
